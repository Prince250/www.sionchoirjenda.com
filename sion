    <p>SION Choir is a Rwandan gospel choir based in Jenda, Nyabihu. It is one of the Rwanda’s most prominent gospel choirs.
The CHOIR comprises 100 members, ranging in age from 18 to 61. They have appeared on national television programs including WARAMUTSE RWANDA, and The Late Show. They have performed in more than 10 churches in Rwanda.
The group was founded  in 1995 (January 15, 1995) by The Youth from Jenda.

    <p>In addition Music ministry is one of the most important ministries in any church. Music ministry enhances
the worship space and “…is a vehicle that ushers in the presence of God. It sets and establishes
an atmosphere that is conducive to worship, enabling the presence of God to move freely among
the congregation, and allowing each person in the congregation to experience the Spirit on a
personal level.”1
As a Gospel Choir our primary mission is to glorify God. We seek to do this by simply giving
our gifts back to the Creator through song. We approach every rehearsal and worship service
with a spirit of gratitude because we accept that all that we are, and all that we have, has been
given in grace by God. We recognize that “every good gift and every perfect gift is from above.”2
As choir members, we are called to be good stewards of those gifts and resources given to us by
the Creator. The Gospel Choir is committed to consistently ministering through music to the
community. Through music primarily rooted in the African gospel tradition, we
minister to others, we celebrate our lives, and we celebrate the many ways we come to God. As
music ministers, we help usher persons to experience God/Creator/Divine
Mystery/Sovereign/Great Ground of Being.
We are a unique Gospel Choir. Our members come from Jenda t. Hence, we are
multiracial, multicultural, and some of us adhere to different faiths. Our unity in spirit enables us
to celebrate one another and empower others on their journeys. Music is universal and reaches
persons at the deepest levels. It has the ability to penetrate and heal the deepest despair and
engender hope. With so much unrest in our world, we are in dire need of the good news, the
Gospel; the Gospel that loves and welcomes not the rhetoric that rejects and judges. This Gospel
Choir seeks to bring and be that good news!
We’ve come a long way! We began as The Youth  Gospel Choir in 1995 under the church of Adepr Jenda. The choir began with a handful of committed Youth. As the choir grew, it was
clear that we needed to widen our name to be more inclusive of all. Therefore, we are officially
called Sion Choir. We sing on a weekly basis in the Gospel Service each
Sunday at 7:00pm in ADEPR JENDA CHURCH. The choir has performed at various events and churches in Rwanda.We hope to continue our growth, as we are always seeking new members. To God be
the glory.</p>

    <p><strong>Donate</strong>At its heart, Givelify is a three-tap, easy way for donors to give to any cause from their smartphones. However, there’s much more to it, like donation tracking for users (think taxes) and a web portal for registered nonprofits that allows them to customize their presence on Givelify, track donations and receive donation payouts.</p>
